  "summary": "The diff implements both REQ-1 and REQ-2 substantially. A MonthYearSelector component is added with month/year dropdowns defaulting to current month/year. The ReportsListPage is updated with an export section containing PDF and CSV buttons, using existing pdfGenerator and excelGenerator utilities, scoped to the authenticated user. A useGetReportWithActivities hook is added for export. Toast notifications handle the 'no report found' case. All major acceptance criteria appear to be met.",
