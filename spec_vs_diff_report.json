  "summary": "The diff implements REQ-1 by adding global CSS rules in frontend/src/index.css that force fully opaque backgrounds on all Radix UI overlay components (Select, Popover, DropdownMenu, etc.) using CSS custom properties and !important overrides. The fix covers both light and dark themes via CSS variables. Some component-level fixes (explicit bg-background classes on dropdowns in ActivityFormPage) are also noted in the file summaries. The implementation appears comprehensive, though the CSS content was truncated so full verification is limited.",
