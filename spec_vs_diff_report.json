  "summary": "The diff adds a migration.mo file and modifies main.mo to wire in the migration via a 'with migration = Migration.run' clause. The migration correctly targets the two specified email addresses and assigns them the #coordination role while preserving all other profile data. REQ-2 is substantially addressed. REQ-1 is partially addressed via the migration hook but the role assigned (#coordination) may not be the highest-privilege administrator role — the system also defines #administration and #coordinator variants, creating ambiguity about which is truly the admin role.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Assign the administrator/coordenador_geral (highest-privilege) role to the two specified users on canister upgrade.",
      "reason": "The migration assigns #coordination rather than #administration. The type definition in migration.mo includes both #coordination and #administration variants. If #administration is the intended administrator role, the two users are being assigned the wrong role and will not gain full privileged access.",
